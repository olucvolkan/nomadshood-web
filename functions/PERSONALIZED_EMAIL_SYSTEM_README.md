# üì¨ NomadsHood Country-Based Personalized Coliving Email System

This system implements an automated weekly email campaign that sends personalized coliving recommendations to subscribers based on their country preferences, featuring curated content including nearby places and local community links.

## üéØ System Overview

### Purpose
- **Personalized Experience**: Each subscriber gets coliving recommendations from their selected countries
- **Country-Based Content**: Tailored content matching subscriber preferences
- **Community Integration**: Local nomad groups and attractions for each featured country
- **Weekly Engagement**: Consistent automated touchpoints with subscribers

### Email Structure per Subscriber
**Subject**: `Your {Country} Coliving Pick: {Coliving Name}`

**Content Sections**:
1. **Personal Greeting**: Customized welcome with subscriber's name and selected country
2. **Featured Coliving**: Selected from one of subscriber's preferred countries
3. **Coliving Details**: Pricing, rating, amenities, and description
4. **Nearby Places**: High-rated local attractions within walking distance
5. **Community Links**: WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook groups for the country
6. **Call-to-Action**: Direct booking links and country exploration options

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core System Flow

#### 1. Subscriber Processing (`getAllSubscribers`)
```typescript
// Filter active subscribers with country preferences
- Fetches from 'mail_subscriber' collection
- Filters subscribers with status='active' AND countries array length > 0
- Returns structured SubscriberData objects
```

#### 2. Country-Based Selection (`selectColivingForSubscriber`)
```typescript
// Smart coliving selection algorithm
- Randomly picks one country from subscriber's preferences list
- Queries colivings by country name OR country_code
- Selects random coliving from top-rated active options
- Ensures variety across weekly campaigns
```

#### 3. Content Generation (`generatePersonalizedRecommendation`)
```typescript
// Comprehensive data aggregation
- Firestore: colivings, coliving_nearby_places, countries collections
- Nearby places: Filters 4+ rated locations by category
- Community links: Platform-specific groups (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook)
- Structured data for email template rendering
```

#### 4. Email Generation
```typescript
// Dual-format personalized emails
- HTML: Responsive design with subscriber's language preference
- Plain Text: Clean formatted fallback version
- Dynamic content: Subscriber name, country preference, selected coliving
```

### Data Sources & Collections

| Collection | Purpose | Key Fields Used |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| `mail_subscriber` | Subscriber preferences | email, countries[], language, name, status |
| `colivings` | Coliving inventory | name, city, country, rating, price, amenities, website |
| `coliving_nearby_places` | Local attractions | nearby_places object with categories and ratings |
| `countries` | Community groups | communities array with platform-specific links |

### Personalization Features

## üìä Automation & Scheduling

### Weekly Automation
```typescript
// Firebase Cloud Function Scheduler
Schedule: Every Monday at 10:00 AM UTC
Cron: '0 10 * * 1'
Batch Size: 25 subscribers per batch
Rate Limiting: 3-second delay between batches
```

### Processing Flow
1. **Subscriber Retrieval**: Fetch all active subscribers with country preferences (10:00-10:02)
2. **Batch Processing**: Process 25 subscribers per batch in parallel (10:02-10:30)
3. **Content Generation**: For each subscriber:
   - Select random country from preferences
   - Find suitable coliving in that country
   - Generate personalized content
   - Send customized email
4. **Logging & Analytics**: Record success/failure statistics (10:30-10:35)

### Manual Testing & Triggers
```typescript
// Admin function for campaign testing
triggerPersonalizedEmails({
  testMode: boolean,          // Send to test email only
  testEmail?: string,         // Test recipient address
  testCountries?: string[],   // Override country preferences for testing
  limit?: number             // Limit number of real subscribers for testing
})
```

## üéØ Content Strategy

### Coliving Selection Criteria
- **Active Status**: Only colivings marked as active in database

  errorType: 'coliving_selection' | 'recommendation_generation' | 'processing_error',
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Campaign Performance Tracking
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully sent emails per campaign
- **Country Distribution**: Which countries are most/least represented
- **Coliving Popularity**: Track which colivings get featured most often
- **Failure Analysis**: Common error patterns and resolution strategies

### Email Delivery Analytics
- **Resend Tags**: Campaign tracking with country and coliving_id metadata
- **Unsubscribe Tracking**: One-click unsubscribe compliance
- **Delivery Reports**: Success/failure rates per batch

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

### Environment Requirements
```bash
# Required Firebase Function environment variables
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Firebase Collections Required:
# - mail_subscriber (with countries array field)
# - colivings (with country and status fields)
# - coliving_nearby_places (with nearby_places object)
# - countries (with communities array)
```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build and deploy all functions
cd functions
npm run build
npm run deploy

# Deploy specific functions only
firebase deploy --only functions:weeklyPersonalizedEmails
firebase deploy --only functions:manualPersonalizedEmails
```

### Testing Procedures

#### Test Mode (Safe Testing)
```typescript
// Send test email to specific address
const result = await triggerPersonalizedEmails({
  testMode: true,
  testEmail: 'your-test@email.com',
  testCountries: ['Portugal', 'Spain', 'Mexico']
});
```

#### Limited Production Test
```typescript
// Test with limited real subscribers
const result = await triggerPersonalizedEmails({
  testMode: false,
  limit: 5 // Only process first 5 subscribers
});
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Subscriber Data**: Minimal data collection (email, countries, language)
- **Email Headers**: Proper unsubscribe mechanisms and compliance
- **Error Logging**: Sanitized error messages without sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Manual triggers require Firebase Authentication

### Email Compliance
```typescript
headers: {
  'X-Entity-Ref-ID': 'personalized-{timestamp}-{subscriber_id}',
  'List-Unsubscribe': '<https://nomadshood.com/newsletter/cancel>',
  'List-Unsubscribe-Post': 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click'
}
```

### Rate Limiting & Best Practices
- **Batch Processing**: 25 emails per batch to respect provider limits
- **Delay Management**: 3-second delays between batches
- **Error Handling**: Individual email failures don't stop campaign
- **Timeout Protection**: Function timeout management for large subscriber lists

## üìã Operational Procedures

### Weekly Campaign Monitoring
1. **Monday 10:05 AM**: Check Firebase Function logs for campaign start
2. **Monday 10:35 AM**: Verify campaign completion status
3. **Weekly Review**: Analyze `personalized_campaign_runs` collection for performance metrics
4. **Monthly Audit**: Review subscriber growth and engagement patterns

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### No Colivings Found for Country
- **Cause**: Subscriber's country has no active colivings in database
- **Solution**: Add more colivings or update country matching logic
- **Prevention**: Regular database audits for country coverage

#### Email Delivery Failures
- **Cause**: Resend API rate limits or invalid email addresses
- **Solution**: Check Resend dashboard and subscriber data quality
- **Prevention**: Regular email validation and rate limit monitoring

#### Processing Timeouts
- **Cause**: Large subscriber base exceeding function timeout
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size or implement pagination
- **Prevention**: Monitor subscriber growth and adjust batch sizes accordingly

### Maintenance Tasks

#### Monthly Reviews
- Analyze campaign performance metrics
- Review and update coliving selection algorithms
- Check subscriber country distribution
- Update community group links

#### Quarterly Audits
- Database cleanup (inactive colivings, outdated community links)
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Subscriber engagement analysis
- System scaling assessments
